# Objects
- Objects can be typed by declaring what the object should look like in the annotation.
- Accessing a property that isn't defined or performing operations without keeping types in mind will throw errors!

# Type Alias
- Instead of writing out object types in an annotation, we can declare them separately in a type alias, which is
simply the desired shape of the object
- This allows us to make our code more readable and even reuse the types elsewhere in our code
