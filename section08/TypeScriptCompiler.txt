# Configuring Typescript

# tsconfig.json file
- "tsc --init": we can create config file for TypeScript project

- tsc -w/--watch index.ts: Anytime we change this file index.ts and save it.
- we can use tsc command for create related js files. but we need to define our classes in tsconfig.json. (files:)

# Out Dir - outdir
- If specified, .js (as well as .d.ts, .js.map, etc.) files will be emitted into this directory.
The directory structure of the original source files is preserved; see rootDir if the computed root is not what you intended.
- If your outDir was dist, TypeScript would write js files to dir file.

# Target Option
- "target": "es2015" => Set the JavaScript language version for emitted JavaScript and include compatible library declarations.

# Strict Option
- Enable all strict type-checking options.

# Non-null Assertion Operator
- "!"
