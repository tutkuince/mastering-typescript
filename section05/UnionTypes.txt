# Union Types
- Union types allow us to give a value a few different possible types. If the eventual value's types is included, Typescript will be happy

- We can create a union type by using the single "|" (pipe character) to separate the types we want to include. It's like saying, "This is allowed
to be this, this or this". TypeScript will enforce it from there.
